# Chill Guy App

Welcome to **Chill Guy App** ‚Äì the app that understands that sometimes, you just need to take a break and let things be. üå¥

## Features:
- **One Big Button**: It's simple, it's big, and it's beautiful. Press it, and you'll feel the magic unfold.
- **10-Second Timer**: When you press the button, a 10-second countdown begins. You can stare at the timer, reflect on your life choices, or just vibe.
- **The Ultimate Chillout**: After 10 seconds, the app *gently* closes itself. No harsh exits. Just a peaceful, calm departure. It's like the app says, "Alright, you've had enough, go outside, take a deep breath."

## FAQs

**Q: What happens if I press the button again?**  
A: You get another 10-second countdown. But remember, the app will still close after those 10 seconds. You can press it as many times as you want, but the result is inevitable. Just like life.

**Q: What if I get impatient and try to press the button too fast?**  
A: We‚Äôre chill here. You can press it again if you‚Äôd like, but it‚Äôs still only going to give you 10 seconds of peace. The app will not judge you, though.

**Q: Can I use this app for productivity?**  
A: Hahahaha, no. This is the *anti-productivity* app. Your only job here is to chill.

**Q: Is there a secret to the app?**  
A: The secret is... that there is no secret. Chill, my friend. Just chill.
